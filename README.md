- 👋 Hi, I’m Dave Handy (@dnhandy).
- 👀 I’m interested in number theory, distributed computation, and D&D.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about react and Django (my current work stack is Angular and Rails API).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [insert "Ain't nobody got time for that" meme].
- 📫 How to reach me: github@davehandy.com.

If you are here, you probably see a whole bunch of incomplete, barely useable applications. This is expected. This is a dumping ground for quick proof-of-concept things, not a place I keep anything nice. Unfortunately, most of that is stored on work servers.
